Download all the 3 .rar files (southpark1v3.7, southpark2v3.7, southpark3v3.7) and make a new folder called southpark in Diablo II\Path of Diablo\filter, put all the sounds in that folder(southpark).

The lootfilter itself also goes to: Diablo II\Path of Diablo\filter.

If you downloaded the sounds with v3.4, v3.5 or v3.6 of the lootfilter you will need to redownload the sounds (southpark1v3.7, southpark2v3.7, southpark3v3.7) since I added some new sounds in v3.7. The southpark folder should have exactly 223 files, if its less than that you have the old sounds.
